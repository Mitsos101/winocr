Description
-----------
                             
 This is a tool that shows how to use the DLLs of the modified sources from GOCR 
 and OCRAD on Windows OSs. GOCR has an windows executable but opening it and 
 getting results from stdin/stdout was a bit unconfortable so I applied some 
 modifications to make DLLs from it that can be used in any windows program.
 OCRAD however never had any windwos build when I checked it out.

 Both OCRs work a bit different and combining the results can improve your final 
 result.

 I hope this is useful for someone experimenting with OCR.
