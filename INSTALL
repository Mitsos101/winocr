Requirements
------------
1. You will need a C compiler for the DLLs. I have build the DLL's with Dev-C++ 5 from
   http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html
   
2. You will need an ObjectPascal compiler for the sample program that uses the DLL's.
   I used Delphi 7 as I own a license for that but any Delphi compiler will do or even 
   Lazarus (http://www.lazarus-ide.org/) or Free Pascal (http://www.freepascal.org/). 
   The source is also not that hard to understand to convert 
   it to any other language.       
   
3. Images in PPM format. See http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html
   Any decent viewer will read or convert this for you like IrfanView.
   
4. You will need a Windows tool to apply the patches to the original sources. I used
   WinMerge - http://winmerge.org/         

Procedure
---------
1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	unzip winocr[version].zip

2. Apply the patches using WinMerg or any other tool of your choice. 
   The *.patch files are in the folder where the two different OCR libs are 
   together with the newly added files.  

3. Compile the DLLs using Dev-C++ or any other compatible compiler.

4. Compile the sample program using any of the mentioned compilers.

5. Put the DLLs (goocr.dll and ocrad.dll) and GSA-Win-OCR.exe into one folder.

6. Use the tool with: "GSA-Win-OCR sample.ppm" or any other sample image as 
   argument.
